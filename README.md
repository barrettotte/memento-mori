# memento-mori

A reminder to stop wasting time.

## Hourglass Animation

Used https://ezgif.com/ to remove duplicate frames from a [Windows 98 loading gif](https://media.tenor.com/5JWmM_Hd3rIAAAAC/loading-windows98.gif).
Then, split it into separate frames and manually converted pixels to a binary format for display on OLED.
